Identify Customer Segment for a Mail Order company using Kmeans Clustering analysis

This project aims to apply **unsupervised learning techniques** to **identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany** based on 2 dataset: the demographics subset of Germany population, and the company's customer datset. 
These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data represents a real-life data science task.
